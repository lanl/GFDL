#
# Canonical author name mapping for git and tools/authors.py, in format:
#
#     Canonical Name <canonical.email@somewhere> Alias Name <alias.email@somewhere>
#
# The email address parts should match what is in git log. The tools/authors.py does
# not care about them, so it is possible to leave the email part empty, but in this
# case git commands won't recognize the alias.
#
# This file is up-to-date if the command git log --format="%aN <%aE>" | sort -u
# does not list the same person multiple times.
