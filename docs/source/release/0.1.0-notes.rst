GFDL 0.1.0 Release Notes
==========================

.. note:: GFDL 0.1.0 is not released yet!

.. contents::

Gradient free deep learning (GFDL) 0.1.0 is the culmination of 6
months of hard work. This first release contains three new estimators.
Our development attention will now shift to bug-fix releases on the
0.1.x branch, and on adding new features on the main branch.

This release requires Python 3.12-3.14.


**************************
Highlights of this release
**************************

* The new :class:`~gfdl.model.GFDLClassifier` is an estimator offering single and
  multi-layer random vector functional link (RVFL) and extreme learning
  machine (ELM) gradient-free neural networks. A regression equivalent,
  :class:`~gfdl.model.GFDLRegressor` has also been added.
* The new :class:`~gfdl.model.EnsembleGFDLClassifier` offers a connected ensemble
  of estimators for multi-layer RVFLs that contribute to model output via
  soft or hard voting.

* Three new estimators that include single and multi layer extreme learning
  machines (ELMs) and random vector functional link (RVFL) networks:
  :class:`~gfdl.model.GFDLClassifier`, :class:`~gfdl.model.GFDLRegressor`, and
  :class:`~gfdl.model.EnsembleGFDLClassifier`.
